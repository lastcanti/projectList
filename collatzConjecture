Collatz Conjecture - Start with a number n > 1. 
Find the number of steps it takes to reach one using the following process: 
If n is even, divide it by 2. 
If n is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1.

def collat(x):
	seq=[x]
	if x < 1:
		return[]
	while x >1:
		if  x % 2 == 0:
			x = x /2
		else:
			x = 3 * x + 1
		seq.append(x)
	return seq
